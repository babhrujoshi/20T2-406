# Grades and policies

##  Grade distribution
The grading scheme that gives the highest individual grade will be used to determine your course grade.

### Scheme 1
* participation : 10%
* assignments (6): 30%
* midterm exam: 30%
* final exam: 30%

### Scheme 2
* assignments (6): 30%
* midterm exam: 30%
* final exam: 40%

## Collaboration

Most homeworks involve programming tasks. You may collaborate and consult with
other students in the course, but you must hand in your own assignments and your
own code. If you have collaborated or consulted with someone while working on
your assignment, you must acknowledge this explicitly in your submitted
assignment. If you are unsure about any of these rules, feel free to consult
with your instructor or visit the departmental webpage on [Collaboration and
Plagiarism](https://my.cs.ubc.ca/docs/collaboration-plagiarism).

## Late submissions

Each student has a three lecture-day allowance to use throughout the term. For
instance, if an assignment is due by Wednesday, then submission by Friday counts
as one delay; a submission by Monday counts as two delays; a submission by the
following Wednesday counts as three delays (and consumes the entire three-day
allowance). Apart from using delays, late submissions are not accepted. Once a
solution set has been posted, no more late submissions are permitted;
consequently, you may not always be able to use all of your delays.


## Policies

* No makeup exam for the midterm or final. If you missed the midterm exam you
  must document a justification.
* Midterm exam grade will not be counted if it is lower than your final exam
  grade.
* To pass the course you must do the assigned coursework, write the midterm and
  final exams, pass the final exam, and obtain an overall pass average according
  to the grading scheme.
* The instructors reserve the right to modify the grading scheme at any time.
