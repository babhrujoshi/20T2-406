# Homework submissions 

Here are some guidelines for homework submissions:

* Solutions must be submitted electronically, using the Canvas system.

* Solutions should be typeset. No handwritten solutions! You have several options
available to you, include PDF files prepared using LaTeX and Jupyter notebooks.
Jupyter notebook submissions are especially encouraged because these are a convenient
way of packaging typeset solutions and corresponding results and code. If you choose
to use a Jupyter notebook, please submit a PDF and the `ipynb` file.

* Adhere to the policy on [collaboration and late submissions](../grades).
